														<h4>Now: Write the History</h4>
														<p style="color: #000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px;">
															To prove that blockchain technologies are real and workable, entire communities must aim and act to benefit. Trust the future and blockchain. The future is not easily built.
														</p>

														<h4>2022: Bitcoin War</h4>
														<p style="color: #000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px;">
															People say and believe that bitcoin is a bubble again. As they said to their banking system in the 1700's.
														</p>

														<h4>2021: Present</h4>
														<p style="color: #000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px;">
															Bitcoin doubled its value in 2021, but in January 2022 saw a big drop that erased almost all of the previous year’s gains. We saw bitcoin skyrocket to an all-time high over $64,000 in the first half of 2021, then just as quickly fall back below $30,000 over the summer. Bitcoin hit another all-time high over $68,000 in November, but by January 2022 had dropped back below $35,000.
														</p>

														<h4>2020: Coronavirus Pandemic</h4>
														<p style="color: #000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px;">
															When the coronavirus pandemic shut down the economy and stirred up fears of inflationary pressure on the U.S. dollar, bitcoin’s price started to accelerate in its upward climb. By December 2020, bitcoin’s price had increased by over 300% since January. The year ended at a price of about $29,374 — the highest it had ever been.
														</p>

														<h4>2019: More Ups/Downs</h4>
														<p style="color: #000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px;">
															Thanks to media coverage and the steep rise in bitcoin’s price, the crypto industry started to take off. Thousands of altcoins were minted, while international diplomats, governments, mathematicians, economists, tech professionals, and financial experts increasingly discussed cryptocurrency regulation and mainstream adoption.
														</p>

														<h4>2017: Bitcoin Breaks $1,000</h4>
														<p style="color: #000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px;">
															After years of price fluctuations ranging between $100 and $900, bitcoin finally broke $1,000 again in January 2017. This kicked off a euphoric bull run phase. Prices doubled to $2,000 in mid-May and then skyrocketed to over $19,000 by December.
														</p>

														<h4>2014: Bitcoin Stalls</h4>
														<p style="color: #000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px;">
															Despite the volatility, these early rumblings were enough to persuade Nelson Merchan, CEO of the blockchain events firm Light Node Media, to look into crypto. A college student at the time, Merchan first bought bitcoin when the price was around $600.
														</p>

														<h4>2013: Bitcoin Breaks $100</h4>
														<p style="color: #000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px;">
															Bitcoin began 2013 around $13.28. It rose to the $30 range in the first quarter of the year, then quickly accelerated in the last week of March. By April 1, bitcoin broke $100. Online forums on Reddit became a hub for curious money enthusiasts and tech professionals wondering why this new asset class — unlinked from any physical commodity — could actually have value.

															By November 2013, bitcoin broke $1,000 — then the price dropped dramatically by December to around $530.
														</p>

														<h4>2011: Bitcoin Breaks $1</h4>
														<p style="color: #000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px;">
															Bitcoin broke $1 in April 2011, entering its first mini “bull run.” It rose by roughly 3,000% over the next three months and peaked between $29 and $32 (depending on the source) by June 2011. By November 2011, the price bottomed out again at $2.

															The following year was uneventful. Bitcoin didn’t bounce back in 2012, finishing the year between $13 and $14.
														</p>

														<h4>2010: The First Jump</h4>
														<p style="color: #000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px;">
															Bitcoin’s first “big” jump happened in summer 2010. The price rose from a fraction of a cent in the spring to $0.09 by July. Very few people, except for very niche tech experts and finance enthusiasts, knew enough about bitcoin to buy the currency. By October, 2010 the price was about $0.10.
														</p>

														<h4>2009: Bitcoin’s Origin</h4>
														<p style="color: #000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px;">
															The invention of the Bitcoin currency (BTC) was simultaneous to the invention of bitcoin as a blockchain, and it was the first of its kind in history.
															“The unit of value (BTC) wouldn’t have been possible without blockchain technology, but there was never a bitcoin blockchain without the currency either,” says Robert Konsdorf, CEO of Facings, a Michigan-based company that creates user-friendly blockchain publishing tools.
															Bitcoin’s first price was $0. The founder, known pseudonymously as Satoshi Nakaomoto, famously released the bitcoin white paper to explain how the new technology would work.
														</p>

														<h4>2008</h4>
														<p style="color: #000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px;">
															On the 18th of August 2008, the domain name bitcoin.org was registered. Later that year, on 31 October, a link to a paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was posted to a cryptography mailing list. This paper detailed methods of using a peer-to-peer network to generate what was described as "a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust". On 3 January 2009, the bitcoin network came into existence with Satoshi Nakamoto mining the genesis block of bitcoin (block number 0), which had a reward of 50 bitcoins.
														</p>

														<h4>2004</h4>
														<p style="color: #000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px;">
															In 2004, computer scientist and cryptographic activist Hal Finney introduced a system called Reusable Proof Of Work(RPoW) as a prototype for digital cash. It was a significant early step in the history of cryptocurrencies. The RPoW system worked by receiving a non-exchangeable or a non-fungible Hashcash based proof of work token in return, created an RSA-signed token that further could be transferred from person to person.

														<h2 style="font-size: 4em; color: #000; font-weight: bold;">Abstract & Importance</h2>
														<p style="color: #000; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 26px;">
														Blockchain technologies have become the most well-known and self-developing sector of today. The number of blocks used in blockchains is structurally increasing day by day. Increasing blocks are downloaded to the devices from 0 to the current block number in the currently used device. The size factor, which slows down the processing power and reduces the hardware life of the devices, can cause many slowdowns and problems around the world. Metachain technology is able to offer device users (miners) faster transaction speed by turning the bulky structure of the currently used blockchain into a modern and lite workable structure.
														<br><br>
														Even now, the world's leading mining companies and individual device owners may have problems with the block scanning time of many blockchains. The number of incompletely scanned blocks is repetitive and the processing times are too long.
														</p>
														<h2 class="mt-4" style="font-size: 2em; color: #000; font-weight: bold;">Importance for Blockchain</h2>
														<p style="color: #000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px;">
														All kinds of community and contribution projects aiming to benefit the blockchain technology, which has succeeded in expanding its technological structure and the scope of benefits it indirectly creates, and which has established itself as a new era, will be in a very important position in the future. The Metachain project will be able to offer a smooth working performance by adapting not only to the bitcoin blockchain, but also to other future blockchains that work by handling RPC connections.

														<p style="color: #fff; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px;">
															Any device with a very small storage area directly accessing the bitcoin blockchain causes many problems in terms of storage and working speed. When we imagine that such heavy and bulky structures are quite light and fast;
															It would be possible for even a smart home lamp to be connected to the bitcoin blockchain.

                        Metachain is an acceleration and mitigation project created to solve the cumbersome and heavy nature of existing and future blockchains. It makes blockchains with high storage and high client speed requirements light and fast.
                        </p>

														<p style="color: #000; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 26px;">
                              We believe that the Metachain project should be developed to improve blockchain technology and prove to be an important construct in the future, and that the community plays a very important role in this development process. Many references were made to the banking and debit card systems, such as balloons and fraud, in the problems that occurred in the first days of banking structures, and the banking sector has become one of the most important structures of today.
                              <br><br>
                              These developing technological structures and revolutions have brought blockchain technologies to a very important point. This process is an opportunity for us to determine how the cryptocurrency and blockchain world will be in the future. We aim to be one of the pioneering projects that all blockchain-related projects that the community will develop with the aim of providing benefit can illuminate the future.
                              <br><br>
                              Our biggest goal is to improve all blockchain activities that may occur in the future, that it can be a simple but effective solution, and to become a preferred brand by contributing to the blockchain world in this process.

                              We attach importance to development by listening to people/companies who have experience in the growing technology world and want to contribute to us, by focusing in detail on the suggestions and complaints that are formed by being with the community, to be able to give confidence to the community along with technological improvements on the way to growth on Metachain.
                              <br><br>
                              We find it important that our investors will want to be with us not only on the technological side, but also on the financial formation side, and that they can trust us and move forward with our project not as an investor but as a business partner.
                              <br><br>
                              We would like to thank all the investors and developers who read and who are among us to contribute to us, and we would like to state that we are happy to be with us.

														<h4>Now: Write the History</h4>
														<p style="color: #000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px;">
															To prove that blockchain technologies are real and workable, entire communities must aim and act to benefit. Trust the future and blockchain. The future is not easily built.
														</p>

														<h4>2022: Bitcoin War</h4>
														<p style="color: #000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px;">
															People say and believe that bitcoin is a bubble again. As they said to their banking system in the 1700's.
														</p>

														<h4>2021: Present</h4>
														<p style="color: #000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px;">
															Bitcoin doubled its value in 2021, but in January 2022 saw a big drop that erased almost all of the previous year’s gains. We saw bitcoin skyrocket to an all-time high over $64,000 in the first half of 2021, then just as quickly fall back below $30,000 over the summer. Bitcoin hit another all-time high over $68,000 in November, but by January 2022 had dropped back below $35,000.
														</p>

														<h4>2020: Coronavirus Pandemic</h4>
														<p style="color: #000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px;">
															When the coronavirus pandemic shut down the economy and stirred up fears of inflationary pressure on the U.S. dollar, bitcoin’s price started to accelerate in its upward climb. By December 2020, bitcoin’s price had increased by over 300% since January. The year ended at a price of about $29,374 — the highest it had ever been.
														</p>

														<h4>2019: More Ups/Downs</h4>
														<p style="color: #000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px;">
															Thanks to media coverage and the steep rise in bitcoin’s price, the crypto industry started to take off. Thousands of altcoins were minted, while international diplomats, governments, mathematicians, economists, tech professionals, and financial experts increasingly discussed cryptocurrency regulation and mainstream adoption.
														</p>

														<h4>2017: Bitcoin Breaks $1,000</h4>
														<p style="color: #000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px;">
															After years of price fluctuations ranging between $100 and $900, bitcoin finally broke $1,000 again in January 2017. This kicked off a euphoric bull run phase. Prices doubled to $2,000 in mid-May and then skyrocketed to over $19,000 by December.
														</p>

														<h4>2014: Bitcoin Stalls</h4>
														<p style="color: #000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px;">
															Despite the volatility, these early rumblings were enough to persuade Nelson Merchan, CEO of the blockchain events firm Light Node Media, to look into crypto. A college student at the time, Merchan first bought bitcoin when the price was around $600.
														</p>

														<h4>2013: Bitcoin Breaks $100</h4>
														<p style="color: #000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px;">
															Bitcoin began 2013 around $13.28. It rose to the $30 range in the first quarter of the year, then quickly accelerated in the last week of March. By April 1, bitcoin broke $100. Online forums on Reddit became a hub for curious money enthusiasts and tech professionals wondering why this new asset class — unlinked from any physical commodity — could actually have value.

															By November 2013, bitcoin broke $1,000 — then the price dropped dramatically by December to around $530.
														</p>

														<h4>2011: Bitcoin Breaks $1</h4>
														<p style="color: #000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px;">
															Bitcoin broke $1 in April 2011, entering its first mini “bull run.” It rose by roughly 3,000% over the next three months and peaked between $29 and $32 (depending on the source) by June 2011. By November 2011, the price bottomed out again at $2.

															The following year was uneventful. Bitcoin didn’t bounce back in 2012, finishing the year between $13 and $14.
														</p>

														<h4>2010: The First Jump</h4>
														<p style="color: #000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px;">
															Bitcoin’s first “big” jump happened in summer 2010. The price rose from a fraction of a cent in the spring to $0.09 by July. Very few people, except for very niche tech experts and finance enthusiasts, knew enough about bitcoin to buy the currency. By October, 2010 the price was about $0.10.
														</p>

														<h4>2009: Bitcoin’s Origin</h4>
														<p style="color: #000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px;">
															The invention of the Bitcoin currency (BTC) was simultaneous to the invention of bitcoin as a blockchain, and it was the first of its kind in history.
															“The unit of value (BTC) wouldn’t have been possible without blockchain technology, but there was never a bitcoin blockchain without the currency either,” says Robert Konsdorf, CEO of Facings, a Michigan-based company that creates user-friendly blockchain publishing tools.
															Bitcoin’s first price was $0. The founder, known pseudonymously as Satoshi Nakaomoto, famously released the bitcoin white paper to explain how the new technology would work.
														</p>

														<h4>2008</h4>
														<p style="color: #000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px;">
															On the 18th of August 2008, the domain name bitcoin.org was registered. Later that year, on 31 October, a link to a paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was posted to a cryptography mailing list. This paper detailed methods of using a peer-to-peer network to generate what was described as "a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust". On 3 January 2009, the bitcoin network came into existence with Satoshi Nakamoto mining the genesis block of bitcoin (block number 0), which had a reward of 50 bitcoins.
														</p>

														<h4>2004</h4>
														<p style="color: #000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px;">
															In 2004, computer scientist and cryptographic activist Hal Finney introduced a system called Reusable Proof Of Work(RPoW) as a prototype for digital cash. It was a significant early step in the history of cryptocurrencies. The RPoW system worked by receiving a non-exchangeable or a non-fungible Hashcash based proof of work token in return, created an RSA-signed token that further could be transferred from person to person.

                        <p style="color: #000; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 26px;">
                        We are aware of the importance of marketing and future deals to grow the project and show more people the importance of the Metachain project. Our project has 3 different roadmaps as short-term, medium-term and long-term. By reviewing our document files, you can follow up exactly what we have planned for all maturities.
                        </p>

                        <h3 style="font-size: 2em; color: #000; font-weight: bold;" class="mt-5">Initiation of Metachain Network</h3>
                        <p style="color: #000; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 26px;">
                        The Metachain project is in a structure that continues its development and can deliver the mobility structure to the collaborative parties to initiate if cooperation is requested. The public offering and the use of individual miners will be completed in Q2-Q3 2023. Of course, all innovations and information from within the network will be shared with the community on a regular basis.

														<h4>Short Term Planning</h4>
                            <p style="color: #000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px;">
                            In our roadmap, which we call the short-term, plans have been created to address the Start-UP and leap phase of our project.
                            Digital Marketing, Social Media Marketing, Search Engine Marketing and E-Mail Marketing, which are the most important in the marketing world and whose validity is undoubtedly agreed upon today, will play a very important role in the short-term planning of our project.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>-    Beginning</b><br>
                            The Metachain project plans to strengthen its marketing by owning all of its social media accounts and to show the Metachain brand to potential people on all social media platforms. As Twitter, Telegram, Medium, Facebook, Youtube, Reddit are the main platforms, the Metachain project primarily aims to introduce itself to its first holders on Twitter and Telegram platforms.
                            <br><br>
                            In line with many auxiliary tools used in Telegram, our Metachain project will be sponsored weekly, bi-weekly and monthly. Buy Tech Bot, Bobby Buy Bot are some of these tools.
                            Providing a proper start to bot structures is very important for the Metachain project. Safe Scan bots and BSCSafeChannel, BSCSafeScan etc. on the Telegram social media platform. standing out in groups is very important for the development and first leap phase of the Metachain project.
                            <br><br>
                            In order to be listed on the platforms where trend creation and trading volume are important, a 24-hour volume contest in the Telegram group together with the Buy Tech Bot partnership and offering a big prize in return will attract the attention of the first investors.
                            <br><br>
                            Coinsniper, Coinmooner etc. called voting site. Keeping the Metachain project actively in TOP5 – TOP10 on platforms is another initial jump planning that will contribute to our project.
